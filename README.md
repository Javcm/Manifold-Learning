# Manifold-Learning
This repositorie includes some notebooks that implement several manifold learning techniques for dimentionality reduction. 

The techniques used are ISOMAP, LLE and t-SNE that are tested in three different data sets. 

Particularly, the t-SNE exploration also includes some Neural networks tool to embeed new elements in a map, by learning the distribution.
